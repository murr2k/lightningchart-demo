## 📊 Chart Descriptions

### 1. Line Chart
- Displays a sine wave with added random noise
- Demonstrates basic line series functionality
- Interactive cursor on hover

### 2. Bar Chart
- Shows monthly sales data
- Vertical bars with value labels
- Dynamic data updates

### 3. Pie Chart
- Market share visualization
- 5 product categories
- Percentage-based distribution

### 4. Area Chart
- Two overlapping area series
- Stacked visualization
- Random data generation

### 5. Real-time Streaming Chart
- Auto-starts after 1 second
- Updates 10 times per second
- Auto-scrolling to show latest data
- Start/Stop controls

### 6. 3D Surface Plot
- Interactive 3D animated wave surface
- Real-time wave animation with Play/Pause controls
- Adjustable wave frequency with slider (0.1 - 3.0)
- Drag to rotate view
- Falls back to 2D heatmap if WebGL unavailable

## 🧪 Testing

Run the automated tests using Playwright:

```bash
node test-charts.js
```

This will:
- Launch a headless browser
- Verify all charts render correctly
- Take screenshots of each chart
- Test interactive buttons

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Adding New Charts

1. Add a container div in `index.html`
2. Create the chart in `main.js` using the LightningChart API
3. Add any interactive controls as needed

### Implementing 3D Animation (v1.1.0)

The 3D surface animation was implemented by creating a data generator that updates the point data array:

```javascript
// Data generator function for animated wave
const generateAnimatedData = (time) => {
    const points3D = []
    const size = 15
    const phase = time * 0.02
    
    for (let x = 0; x < size; x++) {
        for (let z = 0; z < size; z++) {
            const xVal = (x - size/2) * 0.5
            const zVal = (z - size/2) * 0.5
            const r = Math.sqrt(xVal * xVal + zVal * zVal)
            
            // Animated wave equation
            const yVal = Math.sin(r * frequency - phase) * Math.exp(-r * 0.3) * 2
            
            points3D.push({ x: xVal, y: yVal, z: zVal })
        }
    }
    return points3D
}

// Animation loop
const animate3D = () => {
    pointSeries3D.clear()
    pointSeries3D.add(generateAnimatedData(animationTime))
    animationTime++
}
```

Key implementation details:
- The chart rendering code remains unchanged
- Animation is achieved by updating the data array with new Y values
- `requestAnimationFrame` is used for smooth 60fps animation
- Frequency control adjusts the wave pattern in real-time
- The data interface (`{x, y, z}` objects) stays consistent

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Charts Not Rendering
- Check browser console for license validation errors
- Ensure WebGL is enabled in your browser
- Verify all containers exist in the HTML

### License Issues
- Trial licenses expire after 30 days
- Request a new trial from the LightningChart website
- Ensure the license key is properly formatted

### Performance Issues
- LightningChart JS is optimized for large datasets
- Check browser dev tools for memory usage
- Consider using progressive loading for very large datasets
